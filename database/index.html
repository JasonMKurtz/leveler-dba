            MEMO 3/14/20: If you are outside of USA and want to be an admin for people in your country and your communities through this site or want the framework to build your own, please email dbastudionyc@gmail. As soon as site is up and stable will look to make it open source so it can be replicated.
            
            Update: 3/14/20 1:50 AM
            Alessandra again. So I read through all of the suggestions as of right now and many people are suggesting need-based distribution. While funds from the leveler will be distributed equally, here are some additional direct-impact resources that can offer sliding scale and need-based assistance you should consider:
            https://actorsfund.org/
            https://www1.nyc.gov/site/sbs/businesses/covid19-business-outreach.page
            https://covid19freelanceartistresource.wordpress.com/?fbclid=IwAR1Tu5MnMhNWNhhwoeaq2E-ctln3ipKY7N7D2yrH5cr5asVR56Y446qZR10
            
            WHAT THIS IS:
            I’m creating this database to help out my friends in the creative community who are currently being hit hard by COVID health and safety restrictions (venue closures/tour cancellations/shifts lost/commissions canceled/etc and so on). Sam and I are working hard to launch a site in the next few hours. 
            
            This is not a business. I am not collecting your data for any other reason than what is stated here. 
            
            The function of the site will serve two purposes: 1. It will host the database of freelancers impacted, and their venmo/paypal links // 2. It will host a mechanism for our friends with salaried positions to be able to distribute a small portion of wealth in an egalitarian format. Think: Universal Basic Income /  peer-to-peer emergency relief stimulus.
            
            The goal is to receive a critical mass of micro-distributions (5/10 dollars) spread across the database. The database will keep cycling through itself indefinitely, so the cadence of payments you see will likely ebb and flow until it gets a steady traction. THEREFORE, please share this far and wide. 
            
            THE DATABASE: ** THIS IS READY NOW, so get on it if you need to be on it **
            The Leveler database is made up of freelancers and gig economy folks whose jobs are getting canceled, along with their payment information. People who submit to the database should understand that they are putting their venmo/paypal/payment link into a spreadsheet that will be live online. This is the most direct way to get money to you without going through a third party.
            
            If you want to be added to the database PLEASE FILL OUT THE FORM BELOW:
            **** Note: Please only add yourself to this database if you have gigs/shifts/jobs that have already been canceled. 
            
            Suggested Guidelines:
            If you reach your minimum needed amount, please consider removing yourself from the database by emailing an admin: dbastudionyc@gmail.com. 
            This is self-governed and self-policed. If your needs have been met based on the amount of money you lost due to already booked job cancellations, consider distributing excess funds back to your peers through the database.  
            ➡️  https://forms.gle/d658EZJuMJY7ZYuM7   ⬅️
            
            The database is now updating live. Please look out for each other and people you know. 
            Please make sure your payment info is correct. If you see a scam, please flag it. 
            Database can be found here.
            
            IMPORTANT: Don’t forget that you pay tax on income. If you lost a $10,000 job (taxable income) you may only need $6500 of gifts to cover that job. Please consult with your CPA before determining your need and tax consequences of income vs gifts.
            
            THE DISTRIBUTION PROCESS:
            ** THIS IS ALMOST DONE being built on firebase **
            
            If you are a salaried human or don’t feel like you’re at risk of losing your job this week or next, this site was made to make it easy for you to distribute a small portion of your wealth to our friends in the gig economy while we all make it through this extremely weird moment. This process will take a few minutes and is best done on your phone.
            
            Here’s how it works:
            
            By clicking a button, you will be assigned a “Group Number”
            You will then be directed to the database. 
            Look for your group number in the database and distribute to that group only via their payment links.
            Please distribute evenly across that group. In other words, if you have decided you want to distribute 50 dollars, send each of your 10 assigned people $5.00
            The database will cycle through, indefinitely. Distribute once, distribute weekly, distribute however much you want, but whenever you click the button, you will be assigned a list based on where the list is in the cycle. 
            
            Suggested donation is $50.00 sum total. Venmoing 10 people 5 dollars each might feel inconsequential, but if we reach a critical mass, it will add up.
